BLOCKSWAP - Master Blueprint for Block Swap Blockchain
PROJECT OVERVIEW
Name: BlockSwap
Type: Novel Layer-1 Blockchain with Native Cross-Chain Block Validation & Atomic Swap Protocol
Core Innovation: Block Swapping - A revolutionary consensus mechanism enabling trustless cross-chain block validation, atomic swaps at protocol level, and dynamic block state optimization
Deployment: Distributed network (mainnet + testnets)
Programming Paradigm: Multi-paradigm (Functional for core logic, OOP for services)

ðŸŽ¯ BLOCKSWAP UNIQUE FEATURES
What is "Block Swapping"?
BlockSwap introduces three revolutionary concepts:

Cross-Chain Block Validation - Validate and anchor blocks from external chains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) directly into BlockSwap, enabling true interoperability
Atomic Block Swaps - Protocol-level atomic swaps without smart contracts or wrapped tokens
Dynamic Block Optimization - Consensus mechanism allows block "swapping" (replacement) during validation window for MEV prevention and optimal ordering

Key Differentiators

Native cross-chain support without bridges
Zero-knowledge proofs for block validation
Sub-second finality with Byzantine Fault Tolerance
Built-in DEX at protocol level
No wrapped tokens needed
MEV-resistant through fair transaction ordering


ðŸ“‹ PHASE 1: TECHNOLOGY STACK DECISIONS
Core Blockchain Languages

 Rust - Core blockchain node, consensus engine, P2P networking (performance, memory safety, concurrency)
 Go - RPC server, CLI tools, block explorer backend (simplicity, great networking)
 C++ - Cryptographic primitives, low-level optimizations (optional for critical paths)

Smart Contract Layer

 Rust (WASM) - Smart contract runtime (security, portability)
 Solidity-compatible VM - For Ethereum compatibility (optional)

Cryptography Libraries

 libsodium - Core cryptographic operations
 bellman/arkworks - Zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs)
 BLS signatures - Aggregate signatures for consensus
 Ed25519 - Transaction signatures

Frontend & Tooling

 TypeScript + React - Web wallet, block explorer UI

 Python - Testing framework, scripts, analytics

Infrastructure

 RocksDB - State database (high performance key-value store)
 PostgreSQL - Indexer database (historical queries)
 Redis - Mempool, caching
 IPFS - Decentralized storage for large data
 Docker - Node containerization
 Kubernetes - Multi-node orchestration (testnets)


ðŸ“‹ PHASE 2: BLOCKCHAIN ARCHITECTURE DESIGN
Core Architecture Decisions

 Consensus Mechanism: Proof-of-Stake with BFT + Block Swap Extension
 Block Time: 2 seconds
 Finality: 6 seconds (3 blocks)
 Block Size: Dynamic (2-10MB based on network conditions)
 TPS Target: 10,000+ transactions per second
 Validator Set: 100-200 validators (rotating)
 Minimum Stake: 10,000 BSWP tokens

Novel Consensus: Block Swap Consensus (BSC)

 Design two-phase block proposal system:

 Phase 1: Proposal Window (0-1 sec) - Multiple validators propose blocks
 Phase 2: Swap Window (1-1.5 sec) - Validators can propose "better" blocks that replace inferior ones
 Phase 3: Finalization (1.5-2 sec) - BFT voting on optimal block


 Define "block quality" metrics (fees, fairness score, cross-chain validations)
 Implement MEV-resistant transaction ordering (time-weighted fair ordering)
 Design validator incentive structure (rewards for proposing high-quality blocks)

Cross-Chain Block Validation

 Design Block Anchoring Protocol - How external chain blocks are anchored
 Design Light Client Verification - Validate external blocks without full nodes
 Design Merkle Proof System - Verify transactions from anchored blocks
 Support for: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche
 Define trusted block header submission (oracle network or decentralized relayers)

Atomic Swap Protocol

 Design Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLC) at protocol level
 Design Cross-Chain Transaction Format - Special transaction type for swaps
 Implement Swap Matching Engine - Built into consensus layer

## Progress Log (AI Coding Agent)

- Phase 1: Technology stack decisions and environment setup completed (Rust, Go, scripts, Docker, docs, bootstrap, initial dependencies).
- Phase 2: Core architecture parameters defined in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (consensus, block time, finality, block size, TPS, validator set, rewards, epoch, rotation). Created docs/diagrams/ for architecture diagrams.
- Phase 2: Block Swap Consensus specification completed in docs/CONSENSUS.md (all phases, MEV resistance, incentives, diagrams).
- Phase 2: Cross-Chain Validation protocol completed in docs/CROSS_CHAIN.md (anchoring, light clients, relayer network, event system, diagrams).
- Phase 2: Atomic Swap protocol completed in docs/ATOMIC_SWAPS.md (HTLC, matching engine, AMM, cross-chain, fees, diagrams).

- Phase 2: Added Mermaid diagrams under docs/diagrams/: system_architecture.mmd, network_topology.mmd, data_flow.mmd, consensus_flow.mmd, swap_scenario.mmd, anchor_submission.mmd, cross_chain_verification.mmd, btc_to_blockswap.mmd, eth_to_blockswap.mmd, amm_mechanics.mmd, consensus_state_machine.mmd, light_client_verification.mmd, htlc_lifecycle.mmd, same_chain_swap.mmd, cross_chain_swap.mmd, swap_matching_engine.mmd. Linked diagram sources from docs and added scripts/export-diagrams.sh for PNG generation.
